# ccomp
A naive C compiler

ccomp is a C compiler written in C++.
ccomp compiles C programs based on the C90 standard and produces 64-bit x86_64 assembly code as output.

ccomp compiles C code in the following stages
- The Preprocessor processes a set of source files into a single translation unit
- The Lexer transforms the translation unit into a linear sequence of C language tokens
- The Parser transforms the sequence of tokens into an abstract syntax tree
- The Code Generator generates assembly language code from the syntax tree
